This project is written in Java and is used to manage book records in a Library Management System.
The program allows the administrator to add new books by entering details such as ISBN, book name, book type, author name, and cost.
It also provides a search option where users can search for a book using its ISBN and view complete book and author information.
The project validates the input data before storing it in the database, and if the entered details are invalid, it shows an error message instead of processing the request. 
The main purpose of this project is to practice Java concepts such as Servlets, JDBC database connectivity, object-oriented programming, session handling, and web application development using Tomcat Server.
